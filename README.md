#     Network-Monitoring-Security
# 📝 Description
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for network monitoring security, including networking simulations, data ingestion to the cloud, data visualization, machine learning for anomaly detection, automation of reporting, and a user interface using Laravel.

# 🖥️ Installation
# 📋 Requirements
▪️ Python 3.5+  
▪️ GNS3  
▪️ Wireshark  
▪️ MinIO  
▪️ Laravel  
▪️ Docker (optional: for running GNS3 VM, Minio and Laravel containers)
# ⚙️ Setup
    Networking Simulation:
        Install GNS3 following their official documentation.
        Design and configure your enterprise architecture using GNS3, including protocols and devices.

    Packet Sniffing with Wireshark:
        Install Wireshark from their official website.
        Capture training and testing packets for network monitoring.

    Data Ingestion to the Cloud :
        Set up Minio for S3-compatible storage.
        Configure Minio to store captured packets for later analysis.

    Data Visualization :
        Install Python packages required for data visualization using pip install -r requirements.txt.

    ML for Anomaly Detection :
        Install Python packages for machine learning using pip install -r requirements.txt.
        Train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on labeled data for anomaly detection.
        Use the ML model to analyze packets stored in Minio for testing.

    Automation of Reporting:
        Implement scripts or tools for automating report generation based on network activity and anomalies detected.

    User Interface :
        Install Laravel following their official guide.
        Connect Laravel backend to Minio for data retrieval.
        Integrate the ML algorithm into the Laravel backend for real-time anomaly detection.
        Develop a frontend UI for user interaction and visualization.
